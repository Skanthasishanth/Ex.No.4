#### Register Number: 212222100020

### Aim:

To write prompts for different prompt types (Comparative Analysis, Experiential Perspective, Everyday Functioning, Universal Prompt Structures, Prompt Refinements – Prompt Size Limitations) based on a given use case and evaluate them using a rubric.

### Scenario and Use Case:

#### Scenario: The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. IoT devices and embedded controllers will automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.

#### Target Audience: Manufacturing companies in automotive, electronics, and food processing sectors.

#### Main Objectives:

##### Improve production efficiency by 30%.

##### Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.

##### Enable real-time monitoring and remote control.

##### Reduce energy consumption through optimized processes.

### Prompts Designed
#### 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

##### Definition: 

Asking for similarities and differences between concepts.
##### Prompt:
"Compare and contrast the effectiveness of IoT-based predictive maintenance with traditional scheduled maintenance in manufacturing industries."

#### 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

##### Definition: 
Asking from a role-specific or personal viewpoint.
##### Prompt:
"As a plant manager in an automotive factory, explain how IoT-enabled automation would change your daily workflow and decision-making."

#### 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

##### Definition: 
Relating the concept to daily applications.
##### Prompt:
"Explain how predictive maintenance in manufacturing is similar to regular health check-ups for humans."

#### 4. Universal Prompt Structure

##### Definition: 
General, reusable prompt forms.
##### Prompt:
"Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example from a food processing plant."

#### 5. Prompt Refinements – Prompt Size Limitations

##### Definition:
Breaking large or complex tasks into smaller manageable chunks.
##### Prompt:
"List 5 major benefits of IoT-based automation in manufacturing. After that, explain each benefit in detail with examples."

### Evaluation Method: Rubric

| Criteria                  | Excellent (5)                           | Good (4)        | Average (3)        | Poor (2)            | Very Poor (1) |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Clarity of Prompt**     | Clearly worded, no ambiguity            | Mostly clear    | Somewhat clear     | Confusing           | Very unclear  |
| **Relevance to Use Case** | Directly applicable to scenario         | Mostly relevant | Partially relevant | Weak relevance      | No relevance  |
| **Depth of Inquiry**      | Encourages critical/analytical response | Some analysis   | Mostly descriptive | Minimal analysis    | Very shallow  |
| **Practicality**          | Feasible for AI to answer effectively   | Mostly feasible | Partially feasible | Difficult to answer | Not feasible  |


### Evaluation of Designed Prompts

#### Comparative Analysis Prompt → Excellent: Very clear, relevant, and analytical.

#### Experiential Perspective Prompt → Excellent: Strong contextual insight, role-specific.

#### Everyday Functioning Prompt → Good: Simple analogy, helps understanding.

#### Universal Prompt Structure → Good: Clear, generic but effective.

#### Prompt Refinement (Size Limitations) → Excellent: Manages complexity by chunking.

### Result:

The various types of prompts (Comparative, Experiential, Everyday Functioning, Universal Structures, and Prompt Refinements) were designed for the manufacturing automation use case. They were evaluated using a rubric method and found to be successful in meeting clarity, relevance, and practicality criteria.
